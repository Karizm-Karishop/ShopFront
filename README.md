# Kari Shop Project

## Project Overview
Kari Shop is a full-featured e-commerce platform where artists can showcase their shops and sell products, both physical and digital. Clients can browse shops, add products to wishlists or carts, and place orders. Admins oversee user and shop management, ensuring smooth operation across the platform.

This project involves two main parts:
- **Frontend:** Built with Vite, React.js, and Tailwind CSS for a responsive, dynamic, and modern user experience.
- **Backend:** Implements RESTful APIs for handling CRUD operations, user authentication (JWT), role-based access control, and product management.

## Frontend Technologies
- **Vite**: Provides fast build times and a modern development environment for React.js.
- **React.js**: The main framework for building reusable and scalable user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI design and responsiveness.

### Key Frontend Features:
1. **Dynamic User Interface**: Tailored for different user roles (artist, client, admin).
2. **E-commerce Functionality**: Includes shopping cart, wishlist, and checkout flows.
3. **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all screen sizes and devices.
4. **Role-based Dashboards**: Separate views and functionalities for artists, clients, and admins.
5. **Content Management**: Artists can upload and manage products, while clients browse and purchase items.
